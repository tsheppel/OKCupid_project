# OKCupid_project
This project is an exploratory analysis that uses linear regression and ordinary least squares to check the reliability of the average reported income, taken from OKCupid dating profiles, and their self proclaimed body type, drug use, and alcohol use.

This was a project designed for practicing data manipulation, and modeling training/testing data from a dataset.
